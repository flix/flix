# Did You Know?

## Language

Did you know that:

- Flix offers a unique combination of features, including: algebraic data types and pattern matching, 
  extensible records, type classes, higher-kinded types, channel and process-based concurrency, 
  a polymorphic effect system, purity polymorphic functions, and first-class Datalog constraints.

- Flix has no implicit global state. Any global state must be passed around explicitly.

- Flix is one language. There are no pragmas or compiler flags to enable or disable features. 

- Flix supports type parameter elision. That is, in most cases, a polymorphic function does 
  can be written without explicitly declaring its type parameters.

- the Flix type and effect system can enforce purity.

- Flix supports effect polymorphism? For example, the effect of `List.map` 
  depends on the effect of its argument.

- every declaration in Flix is private by default.

- In Flix nothing in is executed before main. There is no global state nor any static initializers.

- Flix supports full tail call elimination, i.e. tail calls do not grow the stack.
  (Flix-- being on the JVM -- has to emulate tail calls until Project Loom arrives.)

- Flix supports extensible records with row polymorphism.

- Flix supports string interpolation by default, e.g. "Hello ${name}". String interpolation
  uses the `ToString` type class -- as it should be.

- Flix supports the "pipeline" operator `|>` and the Flix standard library is designed 
  to make good use of it.

- Flix supports set and map literals `Set#{1, 2, 3}` and `Map#{1 => 2, 3 => 4}`.

- Flix supports monadic do-notation called `let*`.

- Flix supports "program holes" written as either `???` or as `?name`.

- Flix supports infix function applications via backticks.

- Flix compiles to JVM bytecode and runs on the Java Virtual Machine.

- Flix supports channels and processes, including the powerful `select` expression.

- Flix supports first-class Datalog constraints, i.e. Datalog program fragments are values.

- Flix supports compile-time checked stratified negation.

- Flix supports partial application, i.e. a function can be called with fewer
  arguments that its declared number of formal parameters.

- the Flix type and effect system is based on Hindley-Miler.
  The same core type system that powers OCaml, Standard ML, and Haskell.

- the Flix type and effect system is sound, i.e. if a program type checks
  then a type error cannot occur at run-time.

- the Flix type and effect system supports complete type inference, i.e.
  if a program is typeable then the type inference in the Flix compiler
  will find the typing without a single annotation.

- The Flix "Tips and Tricks"-section https://doc.flix.dev/tipstricks/ contains many useful niceties.

- Flix -- by design -- has no implicit coercions (but does provide several explicit coercion functions).

- Flix -- by design -- disallows unused variables and shadowed variables. Research has shown that such
  redundancies are correlated with bugs.

- Flix -- by design -- disallows allow unused declarations. This prevents bit rot.

- Flix -- by design -- does not support function overloading. Instead, functions are given meaningful names, e.g.
  `Map.insert` and `Map.insertWithKey`.

- Flix -- by design -- does not support variadic functions. We believe such overloading
  is unprincipled and unnecessary.

- Flix -- by design -- does not support labelled arguments. Records can be used as an alternative and works
  both for top-level, local, and first-class functions.

- Flix has a unique meta-programming facility that allows a higher-order function to inspect
  the purity of its function argument(s).

- Flix names its floats and integers types after their sizes (`Float32`, `Float64` and `Int32` and `Int64`).

- Controversial: Flix defines division by zero to equal zero.

- Controversial: Flix defines String division as concatenation with the path separator. 
  For example, `"Foo" / "Bar.txt" => "Foo\Bar.txt"` on Windows.

## Standard Library

Did you know that:

- Flix has an extensive standard library with more than 2,000 functions 
  spanning more than 30,000 lines of code.

- the Flix Prelude (the collection of functions which are imported by default) is 
  deliberately kept minimal and contains less than 20 functions.

- most higher-order functions in the Flix standard library are effect polymorphic
  (they can be called with pure or impure functions). The exceptions are functions
  that define (or use) equality, ordering, etc.

- Mutating data structure operations end with an exclamation mark. For example `Array.transform!`.

- the Flix standard library uses records to avoid confusion when functions take multiple arguments of
  the same type. For example, `String.contains` must be called as `String.contains(substr = "foo", "bar")`.

- the Flix `List` module has more than 95 functions.

- the Flix `String` module has more than 95 functions.

- the Flix `Foldable` module offers more than 30 functions.

- the Flix standard library follows the convention of "subject-last" to allow for pipelining (`|>`).

## Ecosystem

Did you know that:

- Flix has an official Visual Studio Code extension.

- Flix has an official dark theme inspired by Monokai called "Flixify Dark".

- the Flix website (https://flix.dev/) lists the design principles behind Flix.

- Flix has an online playground available at https://play.flix.dev/

- Flix has online API documentation available at https://doc.flix.dev/

- the Flix VSCode extension uses the real Flix compiler?

- the Flix VSCode extension supports auto-complete, jump to definition, 
  hover to see type and effect, find all usages, renaming, and more.

- the Flix VSCode extension has built-in snippets for type class instances.
  Try `instance Eq [auto complete]`.

- the Flix VSCode extension supports semantic tokens (highlighting based not just on the syntax, 
  but on the semantics of a program.)

- the Flix VSCode extension has built-in "code hints" that suggests when lazy and/or parallel
  evaluation is enabled (or inhibited by impurity).

- Flix has community build where Flix libraries can be included in the CI process used to build Flix?

- Flix has a nascent build system and package manager (the latter based on GitHub releases). 
  Today it is possible to build, package, and install Flix packages, but there is no dependency 
  management yet.

## Compiler

Did you know that:

- Flix -- by design -- has no compiler warnings, only compiler errors.
  Warnings can be ignored, but errors cannot be.

- Flix uses monomorphization hence primitive values are (almost) never boxed.

- the Flix compiler supports incremental and parallel compilation.

- the Flix compiler has more than 28 compiler phases?

- the Flix compiler contains more than 150,000 lines of code.

- the Flix compiler has more than 12,500 manually written unit tests.

- the performance of the Flix compiler is tracked at https://arewefast.flix.dev/

## Other

Did you know that:

- Flix is developed by programming language researchers at Aarhus University (Denmark) 
  in collaboration with researchers at the University of Waterloo (Canada), and at
  Eberhard Karls University of TÃ¼bingen (Germany), and by a growing open source community.

- Several novel aspects of the Flix programming language has been described in the research literature?

- Flix has received grants from the Independent Research Fund Denmark, 
  from Amazon Research, and from the Concordium Foundation.

- Flix has been discussed on Reddit, HackerNews, and LambdaTheUltimate.

- more than 40 people have contributed to the Flix compiler.

- more than 1,500 pull requests have been merged into the Flix compiler.
