# Pull Requests

- Pull requests should use [Semantic Commit Messages](https://gist.github.com/joshbuchea/6f47e86d2510bce28f8e7f42ae84c716).
    - We use the types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`.
    - The summary should be a single clear sentence (all lower case except for names).
- Pull requests should be a small as possible.
    - An ideal pull request is between one and a few hundred lines of code.
    - A pull request should focus on a single change.
- When you create a pull request, click `Files Changes` to ensure that everything looks as you expect.
    - The easier a pull request is to understand the faster it will be merged. A win-win.
- If the pull request fixes a bug the summary should end with (fixes #9999).
- If the pull request is related to a ticket the summary should end with (related to #9999).
