namespace Concurrent/Channel {

    ///
    /// An enum that represents a multiple-producer, multiple-consumer (mpmc)
    /// channel.
    ///
    /// The tuple corresponds to (
    ///   `id` - an unique id used to order the locking of sets of channels.
    ///       This avoids deadlocks.
    ///   `channelLock` - the lock that guards usage of `elementDeque`,
    ///       `waitingGetters` and `waitingPutters`.
    ///   `unBuffered` - If the channel is unbuffered then an insertion must
    ///       wait for a retrieval before continuing. A channel with a buffer
    ///       size of zero means that `unBuffered` is true and `maxQueueSize`
    ///       is one. In every other case `unBuffered` is false and
    ///       `maxQueueSize` corresponds to the buffer size.
    ///   `maxQueueSize` - the maximum number of elements allowed in
    ///       `elementDeque`. This is strictly positive.
    ///   `elementDeque` - a deque of the channel elements but only used as a
    ///       queue.
    ///   `waitingGetters` - a set of conditions that are waiting for an
    ///       element. This set is notified and cleared after each new element.
    ///       An available element is not guaranteed when notified.
    ///   `waitingPutters` - a condition that is waiting for an element.
    ///       The condition is notified after each new element. Available space
    ///       is not guaranteed when notified.
    /// )
    ///
    /// -- Conditions and Signalling --
    /// When a channel needs to notify threads about available space or elements
    /// then every relevant thread is signalled. This means the if multiple
    /// threads are waiting to retrieve an element and an element arrives they
    /// all get woken up and most of them will again wait on a new element.
    ///
    /// -- Difference of `waitingGetters` and `waitingPutters` --
    /// The reason for the difference between `waitingGetters` and
    /// `waitingPutters` is the select expression. A thread can only wait for
    /// one condition which is a problem when a select expression requires
    /// waiting for a set of channels. Therefore the thread makes a condition
    /// that represents the select expression and hands that to every channel
    /// involved. put is not supported in select so a single condition can be
    /// reused for all insertions.
    ///
    /// -- Locks --
    /// Every condition is tied to a lock but a lock can exist on its own. The
    /// channel has a lock that needs to be held to operate on
    /// `elementDeque`, `waitingGetters` and `waitingPutters`. The
    /// `waitingPutters` condition is tied to the channel lock while the
    /// conditions in `waitingPutters` comes from locks created by the get
    /// function or the select function.
