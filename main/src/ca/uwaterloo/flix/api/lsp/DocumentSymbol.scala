/**
  * Represents a `DocumentSymbol` in LSP.
  *
  * @param name           The name of this symbol. Will be displayed in the user interface.
  * @param detail         More detail for this symbol, e.g the signature of a function.
  * @param kind           The kind of this symbol.
  * @param range          The range enclosing this symbol not including leading/trailing whitespace
  *                       but everything else like comments. This information is typically used to
  *                       determine if the clients cursor is inside the symbol to reveal in the
  *                       symbol in the UI.
  * @param selectionRange The range that should be selected and revealed when this symbol is being
  *                       picked, e.g. the name of a function. Must be contained by the `range`.
  * @param tags           Tags for this symbol.
  * @param children       Children of this symbol, e.g. properties of a class.
