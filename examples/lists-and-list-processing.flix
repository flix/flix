/// We can easily construct and append lists:
def l(): List[Int32] =
    let l1 = 1 :: 2 :: 3 :: Nil;
    let l2 = 4 :: 5 :: 6 :: Nil;
    l1 ::: l2

/// We can use pattern matching to take a list apart:

}

    let l1 = l();
    let l2 = List.intersperse(42, l1);
    let l3 = List.map(x -> x :: x :: Nil, l2);
