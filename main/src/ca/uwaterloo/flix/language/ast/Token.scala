  * A Token holding a kind, line and column.

  * Token does not hold its lexeme directly to avoid duplication of common keywords like "def".
  * Instead it holds a pointer to its source along with start and end offsets.
  *
  * We take extra efforts to ensure that tokens are compact, i.e. have small memory footprint.
  *
  * We do so because [[Token]]s are very common objects.
  *
  * @param kind  The kind of token this instance represents.
  * @param src   A pointer to the source that this lexeme stems from.
  * @param start The absolute character offset into `src` of the beginning of the lexeme. Must be zero-indexed.
  * @param end   The absolute character offset into `src` of the end of the lexeme. Must be zero-indexed.
  * @param sp1   The source position that the lexeme __starts__ on. Must be one-indexed.
  * @param sp2   The source position that the lexeme __ends__ on. Must be one-indexed.
