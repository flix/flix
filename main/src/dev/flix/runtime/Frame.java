 * We use a {@link Frame} to model the resumption of a function with a resume argument.
 * That is, to implement `resume(v)` for some value `v` where the resumption happens inside some function `f`.
 * Then the frame represents the ability to call into `f` at the right place with the value `resumeArg`.
