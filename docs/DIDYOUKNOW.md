# Did You Know?

## Language

Did you know that:

- Flix offers a unique combination of features, including: algebraic data types
  and pattern matching, extensible records, type classes, higher-kinded types,
  polymorphic effects, and first-class Datalog constraints.

- Flix has no global state. Any state must be passed around explicitly.

- Flix is one language. There are no pragmas or compiler flags to enable or
  disable features.

- Flix supports type parameter elision. That is, polymorphic functions can be
  written without explicitly introducing their type parameters. For example,
  `def map(f: a -> b, l: List[a]): List[b]`.

- the Flix type and effect system can enforce that a function argument is pure.

- Flix supports effect polymorphism. For example, the `List.map` function is
  effect polymorphic: its purity depends on the purity of its function argument.

- in Flix every declaration is private by default.

- In Flix no execution happens before `main`. There is no global state nor any
  static field initializers.

- Flix supports full tail call elimination, i.e. tail calls do not grow the
  stack. Flix -- being on the JVM -- emulates tail calls until Project Loom
  arrives.

- Flix supports extensible records with row polymorphism.

- Flix supports string interpolation by default, e.g. "Hello ${name}". String
  interpolation uses the `ToString` type class.

- Flix supports the "pipeline" operator `|>` and the Flix standard library is
  designed around it.

- In Flix type variables are lowercase and types are uppercase.

- In Flix local variables and functions are lowercase whereas enum constructors
  are uppercase.

- Flix supports set and map literals `Set#{1, 2, 3}` and `Map#{1 => 2, 3 => 4}`.

- Flix supports monadic do-notation with the `let*` construct.

- Flix supports "program holes" written as either `???` or as `?name`.

- Flix supports infix function applications via backticks.

- Flix compiles to JVM bytecode and runs on the Java Virtual Machine.

- Flix supports channel and process-based concurrency, including the powerful
  `select` expression.

- Flix supports first-class Datalog constraints, i.e. Datalog program fragments
  are values that can be passed to and returned from functions, etc.

- Flix supports compile-time checked stratified negation.

- Flix supports partial application, i.e. a function can be called with fewer
  arguments that its declared formal parameters.

- the Flix type and effect system is powered by Hindley-Milner. The same core
  type system that is used by OCaml, Standard ML, and Haskell.

- the Flix type and effect system is sound, i.e. if a program type checks then a
  type error cannot occur at run-time. If an expression is pure then it cannot
  have a side-effect.

- the Flix type and effect system supports complete type inference, i.e. if a
  program is typeable then the type inference with find the typing.

- The Flix "Tips and Tricks"-section https://doc.flix.dev/tipstricks/ describes
  many useful smaller features of the language.

- Flix has a unique meta-programming feature that allows a higher-order
  functions to inspect the purity of its function argument(s).

- Flix names its floats and integers types after their sizes, e.g. `Float32`,
  `Float64`, `Int32` and `Int64`.

- Flix -- by design -- uses records for labelled arguments. Records are a
  natural part of the type system and works for top-level, local, and
  first-class functions.

- Flix -- by design -- has no implicit coercions, but provide several functions
  for explicit coercions.

- Flix -- by design -- disallows unused variables and shadowed variables since
  these are a frequent source of bugs.

- Flix -- by design -- disallows allow unused declarations. This prevents bit
  rot.

- Flix -- by design -- does not support unprincipled overloading. Instead,
  functions are given meaningful names, e.g. `Map.insert` and
  `Map.insertWithKey`.

- Flix -- by design -- does not support variadic functions. We believe it is
  better to pass an explicit array or list.

- Controversial: Flix defines division by zero to equal zero.

- Controversial: Flix defines String division as concatenation with the path
  separator. For example, `"Foo" / "Bar.txt" => "Foo\Bar.txt"` on Windows.

## Standard Library

Did you know that:

- Flix has an extensive standard library with more than 2,600 functions spanning
  more than 30,000 lines of code.

- the Flix Prelude, i.e. the functions which are imported by default, is kept
  minimal and contains less than 20 functions.

- most higher-order functions in the Flix standard library are effect
  polymorphic, i.e. they can be called with pure or impure functions.

- the Flix type and effect system enforces that equality and ordering functions
  must be pure.

- the Flix standard library uses records to avoid confusion when a function
  takes multiple arguments of the same type. For example, `String.contains` must
  be called as `String.contains(substr = "foo", "bar")`.

- the Flix `List` module offers more than 95 functions.

- the Flix `String` module offers more than 95 functions.

- the Flix `Foldable` module offers more than 30 functions.

- the Flix standard library follows the convention of "subject-last" to enable
  pipelining (`|>`).

## Ecosystem

Did you know that:

- Flix has an official Visual Studio Code extension.

- Flix has an official dark theme inspired by Monokai called "Flixify Dark".

- the Flix website (https://flix.dev/) lists the design principles behind Flix.

- Flix has an online playground available at https://play.flix.dev/

- Flix has online API documentation available at https://doc.flix.dev/

- the Flix VSCode extension uses the real Flix compiler.

- the Flix VSCode extension supports auto-complete, jump to definition, hover to
  show the type and effect of an expression, find all usages, and more.

- the Flix VSCode extension has built-in snippets for type class instances. Try
  `instance Eq [auto complete]`.

- the Flix VSCode extension supports semantic highlighting.

- the Flix VSCode extension has built-in "code hints" that suggests when lazy
  and/or parallel evaluation is enabled or inhibited by impurity.

- Flix has community build where Flix libraries can be included in the CI
  pipeline used to build the Flix compiler.

- Flix has a nascent build system and package manager based on GitHub releases.
  Today it is possible to build, package, and install Flix packages. Dependency
  management is in the works.

## Compiler

Did you know that:

- Flix -- by design -- has no compiler warnings, only compiler errors. Warnings
  can be ignored, but errors cannot be.

- the Flix compiler uses monomorphization hence primitive values are (almost)
  never boxed.

- the Flix compiler supports incremental and parallel compilation.

- the Flix compiler has more than 28 compiler phases.

- the Flix compiler contains more than 80,000 lines of code.

- the Flix compiler has more than 13,500 manually written unit tests.

- the performance of the Flix compiler is tracked at https://arewefast.flix.dev/

## Other

Did you know that:

- Flix is developed by programming language researchers at Aarhus University
  (Denmark) in collaboration with researchers at the University of Waterloo
  (Canada), and at Eberhard Karls University of TÃ¼bingen (Germany), and by a
  growing open source community.

- Several novel aspects of the Flix programming language has been described in
  the research literature, including its type and effect system and support for
  first-class Datalog constraints.

- Flix is funded by the Independent Research Fund Denmark, Amazon Research,  
  DIREC, the Stibo Foundation, and the Concordium Foundation.

- more than 50 people have contributed to the Flix compiler.

- more than 2,000 pull requests have been merged into the Flix compiler.
