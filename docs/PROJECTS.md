# Project Proposals

Here is a list of projects that are currently open for exploration.

If you are interested in working on any of these projects, feel free to reach
out to us on Gitter. If you are a bachelor or master student at Aarhus
University you can reach out to Magnus directly.

## QuickCheck

QuickCheck frameworks are testing tools used in software development to perform
property-based testing. Instead of writing specific test cases, developers
define properties that their code should satisfy. These properties are then
tested against a large number of automatically generated random inputs.
QuickCheck frameworks generate a wide range of test inputs to explore various
edge cases and potential issues in the code. If a property fails for a
particular input, the framework automatically simplifies the input to find the
simplest case that causes the failure. This helps developers identify and fix
bugs in their code efficiently.

The aim of this project is to (1) explore the design space of QuickCheck
frameworks and to (2) design and implement a QuickChecker for the Flix
programming language. The work will include reading papers, language design, and
implementation in a real-world programming language.

## Package Management

Today, programs are rarely written from scratch, but rather build on a large
collection of external libraries. Different languages have different package
ecosystems: Java has Maven, JavaScript has NPM, Rust has Cargo, and so forth.
All of these languages offer some form of package manager that is used to
download, install, upgrade, and keep track of the dependencies of a software
project. The problem is non-trivial: For example, how should we handle the
situation where a project depends on package A and package B, and A depends on C
(version 1.0), but B depends on C (version 2.0)?

The aim of this project is to (1) explore the design space of package managers
for programming languages, and to (2) design and implement a fully-featured
package manager for the Flix programming language. The work will include reading
papers, language design, and implementation in a real-world programming language.

## Compiler Fuzzing

Compilers are large and complex pieces of software. The correctness of a
compiler is paramount: A compiler that silent mis-compiles (i.e. wrongly
translates) a program is dangerous: We cannot trust the programs we compile and
run! We can test compilers by writing unit tests, but unfortunately such tests
tend to only test the 'happy path' of the compiler. Moreover, the number of unit
tests that can be written is limited. Instead, compiler fuzzing techniques have
been proposed. A compiler fuzzer typically takes a test suite as input and subtly
changes the programs in a systematic fashion and then re-compiles the test
suite. This process is fully automatic and can be run for hours. Often such
techniques, with suitably clever 'mutation strategies', are able to find
significantly more bugs than those found by unit testing.

The aim of this project is to: (1) explore the design space of compiler fuzzing
techniques, and to (2) design and implement such a system for the Flix
programming language. The work will include reading papers, language design, and
implementation in a real-world programming language.

## Code Formatting

A significant part of compiler implementation focuses on the parser: the
compiler phase that turns source code text into abstract syntax trees. However,
the opposite direction is often forgotten: the code formatter that turns
abstract syntax trees back into neatly formatted source code text. Today,
programming languages like Go, IDEs like Intellij IDEA, and linters all come
with built-in support for code formatting.

The aim of this project is to: (1) explore the design space of code formatting
techniques, and to (2) design and implement such a system for the Flix
programming language. The work will include reading papers, language design, and
implementation in a real-world programming language.

## Tail Recursion Modulo Cons

Tail Recursion Modulo Cons (TRMC) is an essential optimization for functional
programming languages that enable very efficient compilation of common functions
such as map and filter. The key idea is the compilation of recursive functions
into imperative while-loops that operate on mutable data (even though the
functional program operates on immutable data).

The aim of this project is to: (1) understand tail recursion modulo cons, and to
(2) implement it in the Flix programming language. The work will include reading
papers, language design, and implementation in a real-world programming
language.

## Termination Analysis

A common programming mistake is to write an infinite loop. Unfortunately, most
contemporary programming languages, such as C, C++, C#, Java, Kotlin, and Scala,
do not help programmers avoid such issues. Termination analysis describes a wide
range of techniques that can verify that a program (or part of a program) always
terminates. For example, by checking that recursive calls always operate on
structurally smaller elements.

The aim of this project is to: (1) explore algorithms for automatic termination
checking, and to (2) implement one of them in the Flix programming language. The
work will include reading papers, language design, and implementation in a
real-world programming language.
