# Guide to Contributors

Hello and thank you for your interest in working on Flix!

The purpose of this document is to help you get started.

## The Standard Process

We don't actually have a standardized process, but usually the following steps happen:

1. You pick an issue on GitHub that you are interested in. 

    It could be adding a new feature, fixing a bug in the compiler, and so forth.

2. You express interest in the issue on GitHub.

    We try to ensure that multiple people are not working on the same issue -- at least not without being aware of it.
 
3. We discuss the issue and how best to fix it.

    The idea is to come up with an implementation plan and to hash out any design choices.

4. You fork the Flix repository to your own account on GitHub.

5. You clone this repository to your local machine.

6. You make the required changes, add test cases, documentation, and so forth.

7. You push the local changes to your GitHub repository and create a new pull request (PR).

8. Travis CI automatically compiles and tests the PR. Be sure to check the results!

9. We perform a code review and iterate on the implementation.

10. If the code is of sufficient quality it is merged in!

*Note:* 

You must agree to release your contributions under the Apache 2.0 license.

You affirm this by adding yourself to AUTHORS.md.
