/**
  * Priority for completions.
  * 
  * Using a priority, we can make certain suggestions occur earlier in
  * the list of suggestions by generating a SortText using `Priority.toSortText`
  * on the relevant priority and label. This SortText can then be used in the `CompletionItem`
  * for the suggestion.
  *
  * In practice, we leverage the alphabetical sorting of completions by
  * associating each priority with a number. The higher the priority,
  * the lower the number. Then `Priority.toSortText`
  * prepends that number to the label. This results in completions which
  * are firstly sorted by the priority and then by name.
