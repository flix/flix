/**
  * Represents a `SymbolInformation` in LSP.
  * Provides information about programming constructs like variables, classes, interfaces etc.
  *
  * @param name           The name of this symbol.
  * @param kind           The kind of this symbol.
  * @param tags           Tags for this symbol.
  * @param deprecated     Indicates if this symbol is deprecated. (@deprecated Use tags instead)
  * @param location       The location of this symbol. The location's range is used by a tool
  *                       to reveal the location in the editor. If the symbol is selected in the
  *                       tool the range's start information is used to position the cursor. So
  *                       the range usually spans more then the actual symbol's name and does
  *                       normally include things like visibility modifiers.
  *                       The range doesn't have to denote a node range in the sense of a abstract
  *                       syntax tree. It can therefore not be used to re-construct a hierarchy of
  *                       the symbols.
  * @param containerName  The name of the symbol containing this symbol. This information is for
  *                       user interface purposes (e.g. to render a qualifier in the user interface
  *                       if necessary). It can't be used to re-infer a hierarchy for the document
  *                       symbols.
