/**
  * Represents a `CodeAction` in LSP.
  *
  * A `CodeAction` should be associated with an edit and/or a command.
  *
  * @param title          A short, human-readable, title for this code action.
  * @param kind           The kind of the code action. Used to filter code actions.
  * @param diagnostic     The diagnostics that this code action resolves.
  * @param isPreferred    Marks this as a preferred action. Preferred actions are used by the
  *                       `auto fix` command and can be targeted by keybindings.
  * @param disabledReason If `Some`, marks that the code action cannot currently be applied.
  *                       It will appear greyed out with the supplied string displayed as the reason.
  * @param edit           The workspace edit this code action performs.
  * @param command        A command this code action executes. If a code action
  *                       provides an edit and a command, first the edit is
  *                       executed and then the command.
