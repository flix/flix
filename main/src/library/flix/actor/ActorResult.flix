/// An actor result represents the outcome of an actor.

/// An actor must (eventually) return with one of three values:
///
/// - An actor must return `Done` when it has successfully completed its work.
///
/// - An actor must return `ResumableCrash(k, e)` when it encounters an error `e` it cannot handle normally,
///   but the actor can still be resumed with the continuation `k`. The continuation `k` should
///   encapsulate the last known good state of the actor.
///
/// - An actor must return `NonResumableCrash(e)` when it encounters an error `e` and cannot be resumed.
///   The error is permanent and there is no hope of resuming the actor from its current state.
///
/// @param e the type of the error.
