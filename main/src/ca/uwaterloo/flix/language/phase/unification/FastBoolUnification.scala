/// Fast Type Inference with Systems of Boolean Unification Equations
///
/// Work smarter, not harder -- Proverb
///
/// A Fast Boolean Unification Solver based on the following ideas:
///
/// - We work on all the equations as one whole system.
/// - We assume the equation system has been put into normal form. This avoids the need to mirror a lot of cases.
///   - We move true and false to the rhs.
///   - We move a single variable to the lhs.
///   - See the definition of `Equation.mk` for details.
/// - We progress in the following order:
///   1. We propagate ground terms (true/false/constant) in a fixpoint.
///   2. We propagate variables (i.e. resolving constraints of the form x = y).
///   3. We perform trivial assignments where the left-hand variables does not occur in the RHS.
///   4. We eliminate (now) trivial and redundant constraints.
///   5. We do full-blown Boolean unification with SVE.
/// - We represent a conjunction with n >= 2 terms.
///   - We group the terms into three: a set of constants, a set of variables, and a list of sub-terms.
///   - We flatten conjunctions at least one level per call to `mkAnd`.
///
/// In the future, we could:
/// - Explore change of basis.
/// - Explore use slack variables (i.e. variables marked don't care, and use SAT).
/// - Explore in detail how constraints are generated.
/// - Explore whether to run Phase 1-3 after _ONE_ SVE computation.
